## 🕊️ The Journey of the Swift

In a world where supply chains have become labyrinths of disconnected records and broken trust, **Averiun** emerges as the singular beacon guiding back to the origin.

Our symbol, the swift, represents an uninterrupted journey—cutting through complexity with precision, flying above the fog of doubt, and always finding its way home to the truth.

## 🌟 What We Build

Averiun is the **Singular Master Registry** for sustainable supply chains, powered by our own distributed ledger technology. We don't create another version of the story—we create the **only version**, immutable and certified.

### Our Ecosystem

- **[Ave Node](https://github.com/Averiun-Ledger/ave)** - Event-sourced DLT protocol optimized for governance and traceability
- **[Ave Protocol](https://github.com/Averiun-Ledger/ave-protocol)** - Industrial IoT gateway bridging physical assets to blockchain
- **Ave Launcher** - Enterprise management interface for complete supply chain visibility

## 💎 The Averiun Promise

```
AVUS (Origin, Ancestor)    → We honor the authentic lineage
VERITAS (Truth, Genuine)   → We certify immutable transparency
-UN (Singular, Unique)     → We are the One System of Truth
```

**Averiun is not just a record—it is *the* record.**

Every entry is a singular oath. Every trace is the definitive version of reality. No ambiguity. No alternatives. Only truth.

## 🚀 Why Averiun?

| Traditional Systems | Averiun Ledger |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Multiple conflicting records | **Single source of truth** |
| Mutable, editable logs | **Immutable, cryptographic proof** |
| Fragmented data silos | **Unified distributed registry** |
| Trust through intermediaries | **Trust through mathematics** |
| Opaque supply chains | **Radical transparency** |

## 🔧 Core Technologies

- **Ave Node**: Event-sourced blockchain optimized for governance and supply chain traceability
- **Industrial Protocols**: Modbus, OPC UA, MQTT native integration
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: Ed25519 signatures, SHA-256 hashing
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time data ingestion from industrial sensors
- **Smart Contracts**: Rust-based validation schemas

## 🌍 Use Cases

### Supply Chain Traceability
Track products from raw material to consumer with cryptographic certainty. Every transformation, every custody transfer, recorded immutably.

### Industrial IoT
Bridge the gap between OT (Operational Technology) and blockchain. Sensors, PLCs, and SCADA systems feeding directly into an immutable ledger.

### Sustainability Certification
Prove environmental claims with mathematical certainty. Carbon footprint, fair labor practices, ethical sourcing—all verifiable on-chain.

### Regulatory Compliance
Meet EUDR, CSRD, and other regulations with auditable, tamper-proof records that regulators can trust.

## 📚 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the Ave Protocol gateway
git clone https://github.com/Averiun-Ledger/ave-protocol.git
cd ave-protocol

# Run with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Or build from source
cargo build --release
```
